# UniversityRanking
Ranking universities is a difficult, political, and controversial practice. There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each other. This Kaggle dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places. 
In this project I have used mainly three datasets. 
     1. timesData
     2. shanghaiData
     3. cwurData
I tried my best to compare two ranking systems. Times vs Shanghai. From the graph and result one can check the ranking of the universities by both systems.
From the observations it can be said that USA is the best country for study as almost 54% universities in top50 are in USA so USA is a clear winner.
